title: Introduction to Probability Spaces 
---

When describing something that requires a probabilistic description, we have to define how probability will describe our task. This requires us to define a clear mathmatical description as to how the task can be expressed mathematically through a Probability Triple. The elements of this triple $$(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$$ are defined as follows:

1. $$\Omega$$ - The **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes.
2. $$\mathcal{F}$$ - An **event space** is a **$$\sigma$$-Algebra** over $$\Omega$$. It is a set of sets composed of the sample space. 
3. $$P$$ - **Probability Measure** that tells us the probability of each element in $$\mathcal{F}$$.

In order to undestand these further, let's try to build a strong intuition first, and then build upon that intuition mathematically.

### 1. **Sample Space** $$\Omega$$ 
### - Intuition
A **sample space** can be thought of as the set of all possible outcomes. Imagine you want to listen to music and you're thinking about which piece of music to choose. Any and all music in your memory can be organized into a set; this is the set of all possible outcomes(songs) that is named the *sample space*.
