# Introduction to Probability Spaces 

When describing something that requires a probabilistic description, we have to define how probability will describe our task. This requires us to define a clear mathmatical description as to how the task can be expressed mathematically through a Probability Triple. The elements of this triple $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ are defined as follows:

1. $\Omega$ - The **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes.
2. $\mathcal{F}$ - An **event space** is a **$\sigma$-Algebra** over $\Omega$. It is a set of sets composed of the sample space. 
3. $P$ - **Probability Measure** that tells us the probability of each element in $\mathcal{F}$.
